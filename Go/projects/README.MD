# the BookingApp 
the BookingApp is program for booking tickets to an event.

It then calls various functions to validate the user's input, book the tickets, and send a confirmation email to the user.

Some of the key concepts and elements in this code include:

**package main**: This line indicates that this code is part of the main package, which is the default package for an executable program in Go.

**import:** The import keyword is used to include packages from other parts of the Go standard library or from external libraries.

**const and var**: const is used to declare a constant value, while var is used to declare a variable.

**struct**: A struct is a data type that allows you to define a composite data type by grouping together related values. In this code, the UserData struct is used to store information about a user who has booked tickets.

**sync.WaitGroup**: A WaitGroup is a type provided by the sync package in the Go standard library that allows you to wait for a group of goroutines to finish.

**go:** The go keyword is used to launch a function as a goroutine, which is a lightweight concurrent process. In this code, the sendTicket function is launched as a goroutine.

**fmt.Println** and **fmt.Printf**: These functions are part of the fmt package in the Go standard library and are used to print output to the terminal. Println prints a line of output, while Printf allows you to specify a formatting string to control the layout of the output.
