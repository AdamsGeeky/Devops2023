# Mongo Express,
 
also known as "MEAN Stack Admin", is a web-based application that provides a graphical user interface for managing MongoDB databases. It is an open-source project and is built using Node.js and Express.js frameworks.

With Mongo Express, users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their MongoDB databases. It also provides features such as database and collection management, index creation and management, user authentication and authorization, and query execution.

Mongo Express is a popular tool for developers and database administrators as it provides a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring MongoDB databases. It is also highly customizable, with the ability to create custom views and actions, and supports plugins to extend its functionality.

Note that Mongo Express is not meant to be used in production environments, as it does not provide the same level of security and performance optimizations as dedicated MongoDB management tools. It is mainly intended for development and testing purposes.
