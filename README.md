# Devops2023
# How do I start learning DevOps?
Start by learning:

The Culture.
A Programming Language.
Manage Servers.
Networking & Security Basics.
Scripting.
Installing & Configuring Middlewares.
Deploying Software.


# introduction to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering

To make the most of this course, you will need to have:
Intermediate understanding of Linux systems.
Knowledge of networking concepts, utilities and troubleshooting.
Basic scripting knowledge.
Computer and network security concepts.
Virtualization concepts.
Systems administration and troubleshooting skills.

# GitOps
Prerequisites
Understanding of Kubernetes and Git-based workflows. 
Understanding of CI/CD processes
# jenkins
Prerequisites
To make the most of this course, you will need to have:
Basic knowledge of software development lifecycle (SDLC).
Basic knowledge of software configuration management (SCM) tools, such as GIT.

No prior technical knowledge is assumed as part of this course, as it is intended to form or improve a foundation for any software leader.

he critical skills required for DevOps are: 

Strong knowledge of application development life cycle (ALC) 
Strong knowledge of infrastructure as code (IAC) 
Strong knowledge of configuration management 
Strong knowledge of continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD).


his short comparison is enough to let you know why the â€˜Waterfall modelâ€™ is the thing of the past and why â€˜DevOps cultureâ€™ is the way forward:

BEFORE DEVOPS
AFTER DEVOPS
Waterfall approach for product delivery	Continuous Software Delivery
Slow launches	Faster feature shipments
Higher downtimes	Faster resolution times
Low productivity due to less transparency	Enhances team productivity
No scope of having green environments	Stable Dev and Prod environments
Difficult to manage and less flexible	Efficient management
Lack of documentation due to less collaboration between teams	Common documentation â€“ Dev and Ops team
Less accountability	Higher rate of satisfaction
Lack of team coordination	Improved collaboration
Less efficient engagement	Higher rate of communication
Less room for improvement	Improved Quality
Haphazard code merge	Speedy execution
DevOps practices have enhanced the collaboration between Development and Operations teams. This collaboration helped in continuous business planning. This collaboration was one of the missing pieces in the â€˜Before DevOpsâ€™ era, and I have witnessed both eras! ðŸ™‚

# Understanding Fundamentals of Operating Systems
An operating system (OS) is defined as an interface between the user and the hardware. It is essential to learn a bit about OS concepts as you will work with servers and applications. Hence, it is crucial to know for which OS you will write the code.

Kernel and memory management, threading, concurrency, sockets, POSIX basics, file and I/O management, virtualization, etc., are some of the important OS concepts. Understanding these OS concepts gives you an edge over others as a DevOps engineer in terms of memory and disk usage, optimization, allocation of resources, processes, etc.

At present, Linux is the most used OS in the IT industry. Other examples of OS are Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora, Unix, CentOS, etc. In Fact, as per Statista, the most popular technology skill in the DevOps tech stack in 2021 was Linux, chosen by nearly half of the respondents.

# Knowing Basics of Terminal and Shell Scripting
Getting comfortable with terminal commands is a prerequisite to being a DevOps engineer. Practicing these commands daily for process monitoring and manipulation of system performance polishes your scripting skills.

Terminal lets you accomplish different tasks without the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is also known as console or command line.

Below are some of the basic shell scripting functions to learn to get started with DevOps:

Text Manipulation
Compilation
Bash or Shell Scripting
System Performance
Powershell/VIM, etc.

# Understanding Networking Concepts
When running an interconnected system of servers, apps, and resources on a network, it is crucial to learn about the networking and security concepts to diagnose any troubleshooting issues or network issues.

A few of the networking concepts that you must get familiar with are stated below:

TCP/IP network protocols
HTTP and HTTPS
SMTP and FTP
SSL/TLS
Network Forwarding
Firewall and Proxy
Understanding networking allows you to create an environment where you can test your functions and put continuous integration and delivery pipelines in place. Letâ€™s explore the continuous integration and deployment concept in the next section of this article on getting started with DevOps.

# Technological Automation
Learning about automation is an important part of DevOps. The ability to automate hefty processes of managing servers and deployments is something that recruiters look for in an ideal DevOps candidate.

Automation certifications and courses may help to understand the details of automating processes. The approach should be to automate anything you perform manually more than two times. The CI/CD best practices and everything-as-code helps you and your organization adopt the DevOps culture better. You can learn more about it by going through these articles on the importance of automation testing in DevOps and the role of automation testing in the CI/CD pipeline. In a nutshell, automating testing is a backbone for DevOps.
