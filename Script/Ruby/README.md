# Ruby

Ruby can be a good choice for scripting, as it is designed to be easy to read and write, and it has a large number of libraries and gems (collections of pre-written code) available for various tasks. The dynamic, interpreted nature of Ruby means that it can be quickly prototyped and modified for a variety of purposes, making it well-suited for scripting tasks. Additionally, Ruby has a number of features that are well-suited to scripting, such as its ability to easily manipulate strings and perform file I/O operations.

# Ruby script

Ruby is a powerful scripting language. Scripts can be used to automate tasks such as creating and searching files and managing and organizing subdirectories. Companies like GitHub, Chef and Puppet use Ruby for scripting. Devops teams use scripting to combine development and operations.


We’ll use Ruby as a **scripting language**  particularly interested in scripting, 

We’ll use **scripts mainly** to increase our familiarity with Ruby techniques such as 

```ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts "Hello world!"

```
