# A script 

is a series of instructions written in a specific programming language that automates a task or process. Scripts are typically executed by an interpreter or a runtime environment, and can be used for a variety of purposes, including automating repetitive tasks, processing data, or controlling other software. Scripts can be simple and short, or complex and extensive, depending on the task they are designed to perform. Some common types of scripts include 
- [shell scripts](), 
- [Perl scripts](), 
- [Python scripts](Python/README.md), 
- [Ruby scripts](Ruby/README.md).

# Scripting

Scripting refers to the writing of scripts, or short programs, that automate tasks. A script typically consists of a series of commands written in a specific programming language, and it is executed by an interpreter or a runtime environment.

Scripts can be used for a variety of purposes, including automating repetitive tasks, processing data, or controlling other software. Scripting is commonly used in areas such as 
- system administration, 
- web development, 
- data analysis, 
  
as it allows for quick and efficient implementation of simple tasks without the need to write full-fledged applications.

# Automation 

is the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention. The goal of automation is to increase efficiency, reduce the risk of human error, and save time and resources. Automation can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including manual processes, repetitive tasks, and complex processes that would otherwise require human intervention. Automation can be achieved through various means, including the use of scripts, software programs, and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. In many industries, automation is seen as a crucial component for achieving increased productivity and competitiveness. Automation is being used in many areas,
including -
- manufacturing,
- transportation, 
- healthcare, 
- finance, among others.

# Scripting and automation 

are closely related concepts. 
**Automation** refers to the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention. 

**Scripting**, on the other hand, is the process of writing a script, or a small program, that automates specific tasks. 

Scripting is often used as a means of achieving automation, as scripts can be written to automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks, freeing up time and resources for other tasks. 

By using scripts, tasks that would otherwise need to be performed manually can be automated, reducing the chances of human error and increasing efficiency. 

Automation can be achieved through a variety of means, including the use of **scripts**, as well as the use of more advanced technologies such as **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**.


## The following are some of the common prerequisites for learning scripting:

1. Basic programming concepts: understanding of concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures is important for scripting.

2. Familiarity with a specific programming language: depending on the type of scripting you are interested in, you may need to have a basic knowledge of a specific programming language, such as Python, Ruby, or Perl.

3. Understanding of text processing: most scripting languages are designed to work with text, so a basic understanding of text processing, such as string manipulation and file I/O, is important.

4. Familiarity with command-line interfaces: many scripting tasks are performed using command-line interfaces, so a basic understanding of navigating and using the command line is important.

5. Problem-solving skills: scripting often involves solving specific problems or automating tasks, so having strong problem-solving skills is important.

These prerequisites can vary depending on the type of scripting you are interested in and the tasks you plan to automate. However, these general prerequisites should provide a good starting point for anyone interested in learning scripting.
