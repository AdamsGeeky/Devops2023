# The controllers directory 
contains the Controller files. Each Controller file contains the logic for a specific set of user actions.

# The models directory
contains the Model files. Each Model file represents a specific data entity and provides methods for retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

# The views directory 
contains the View files. These are typically HTML templates or rendering engines like EJS or Pug that provide the structure for the presentation layer.

# The routes directory 

contains the routing files. These files define the routes for the application and specify which Controller method should handle each route.

**The app.js** file is the entry point for the application. It sets up the server and defines middleware for handling requests and responses.

**The package.json** file contains information about the project dependencies and scripts.

**Note that this is just a basic structure and you may need to modify it based on the requirements of your application.**
