This is what we read: There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. 

The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.


We now accept the fact that learning is a lifelong process of keeping abreast of change. And the most pressing task is to teach people how to learn.

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
